Today, bicycles are elegantly simple machines that are common
around the world. Many people ride bicycles for recreation, whereas
others use them as a means of transportation. The first bicycle, called
a draisienne, was invented in Germany in 1818 by Baron Karl de Drais
de Sauerbrun. Because it was made of wood, the draisienne wasn’t
very durable nor did it have pedals. Riders moved it by pushing their
feet against the ground.
In 1839, Kirkpatrick Macmillan, a Scottish blacksmith, invented
a much better bicycle. Macmillan’s machine had tires with iron rims
to keep them from getting worn down. He also used foot-operated
cranks, similar to pedals, so his bicycle could be ridden at a quick
pace. It didn’t look much like the modern bicycle, though, because
its back wheel was substantially larger than its front wheel. Although
Macmillan’s bicycles could be ridden easily, they were never produced in large numbers.
In 1861, Frenchman Pierre Michaux and his brother Ernest
invented a bicycle with an improved crank mechanism. They called
their bicycle a vélocipède, but most people called it a “bone shaker”
because of the jarring effect of the wood and iron frame. Despite
the unflattering nickname, the vélocipède was a hit. After a few years,
the Michaux family was making hundreds of the machines annually,
mostly for fun-seeking young people.
Ten years later, James Starley, an English inventor, 
made several innovations that revolutionized bicycle design. He made the front wheel many times larger than the back wheel, put a gear on the
pedals to make the bicycle more efficient, and lightened the wheels
by using wire spokes. Although this bicycle was much lighter and less
tiring to ride, it was still clumsy, extremely top-heavy, and ridden
mostly for entertainment.
It wasn’t until 1874 that the first truly modern bicycle appeared
on the scene. Invented by another Englishman, H. J. Lawson, the
safety bicycle would look familiar to today’s cyclists. The safety
bicycle had equal-sized wheels, which made it much less prone to
toppling over. Lawson also attached a chain to the pedals to drive the
rear wheel. By 1893, the safety bicycle had been further improved
with air-filled rubber tires, a diamond-shaped frame, and easy braking. With the improvements provided by Lawson, bicycles became
extremely popular and useful for transportation. Today, they are
built, used, and enjoyed all over the world
